# The Making

The original Idea belongs to Angela Yu, and so does all the credits for it and orignally it was made using Bootstrap 4.0. This mock implementation of **Tindog** is done by UtkarshJoshi using Bootstrap 5.1.3, there are slight differences while making it compared to 4.0 and that gives a good challenge for your CSS skills.
The site uses major bootstrap components, it is mobile friendly and responsive to viewport size.
Major components are bootstrap form grid, carousels, cards.


## Disclaimer

This is just a mock site, Tindog currently is not a product in the market, might be in some alterante universe ðŸŒŒ but not in this one, atleast currently.
